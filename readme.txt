What was hard in this ex?

everything ;_;

What was fun in this ex?

seeing something actually work, especially the list example

If I were a hacker I would try these two functions

function(req,res,next) {
	while (true){
		fs.read(file);
	}
}
infinite IO and cpu use until crash

function(req,res,next) {
	while (true){}
}
just infinite cpu use until crash

I will guarntee the function will run by sending multiple get requests for the resource specified
